# Hi! I'm Hussein.

I've been in the software industry for 13 years. I've worn many hats, but I care most about building an **incredible working environment** where engineers are **happy, productive, and constantly growing**.

<div style="clear:left"></div>

## Work I love

### Scaling engineering teams

Developing engineers has been **the most rewarding work I've done**:

🪜 Read how [**I rebuilt our career ladder**](/levels) with Engineering Managers.

🧠 I care a lot about building a good **interview process**. I run a fantastic interview: see my [**interviewing tips**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qNeXN_E_na_KXsZMaXRfYQcoT-0w59yjdmN1B7Tst68/edit#){:target="_blank"}.

🏄 I love putting together **onboarding programs** and am constantly thinking about the new hire experience.

💡 I've also [pitched](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dgl6OwC9FHX-6oT9Z1JCmPglDmW9umv0/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114804907504664516654&rtpof=true&sd=true){:target="_blank"} and [**launched a 10% time policy**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z81KCX6tuKLnSct5oFamhEvcFCJIPGOL/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114804907504664516654&rtpof=true&sd=true){:target="_blank"}.

🌟 Plus: **leading teams**, **working with other leaders** to define policy, **mentoring** junior engineers, etc.

### Solving high-impact problems

I'm naturally a **systems thinker** and am magnetically attracted to big-ticket problems, technical or otherwise. I count [rebuilding our software engineering career ladder](/levels) as one example, but here are a couple of others:

🗜 DNA sequence data is huge. I **created a lossy compression format 4% the size of its source file** and ~28% the size of its competitor, and flew to Switzerland to present the results to the [Global Alliance for Genomics & Health](https://www.ga4gh.org/){:target="_blank"}. Watch [the talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaqFBgaZHmE&t=13920s){:target="_blank"} or flip through [the slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EAG3Mz_Rwszn1xzvLFlFDtZJKeTfTcqo/edit){:target="_blank"}.

⏱ I **dropped integration test runtimes from 55 minutes to 15 minutes** by [building a microservice to pool slow-to-create resources](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gpalloc){:target="_blank"} after hearing someone say "I guess I'll raise the timeout to 20 minutes".

⚙ Plus: more on the [Projects](/projects) page.

### Teaching and learning

I love **learning complex systems**, exploring data to come up with ideas and test hypotheses, and **teaching** what I've learned.

🧬 Read my [**crash course on genomics for computer scientists**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-C_BI4mx0Amjxac7G908Wtmfuc_N8O4_UqSDPiZu_bo/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}!

🚀 Or maybe you'd prefer to learn [**the inner workings of options markets**](https://helgridly.github.io/finstuff/understanding-NOPE/){:target="_blank"}?

✍ Plus: _plenty_ more on the [Writing](/writing) page.

## Could you be my dream job?

I'd love to apply my skills and enthusiasm in a way that's rewarding and helpful; [this profile](https://staffeng.com/stories/rick-boone) sounds appealing to me. A good step in that direction might be something like an EM/TPM role, but every org's needs are different and I'd rather figure out fit over a coffee than get hung up on labels.

It's important that the work I do makes a **tangible, positive** difference in people's lives. I'm open to opportunities in the Boston area, or remote (sorry, no relocating).

Think we might be compatible? Say hi! `hussein@thisdomain`. (My resume is [here](/resume).)
