Hi! I'm Hussein.

I've been in the software industry since I graduated in 2008. I have worn many hats: been an IC, done systems design, led teams, mentored junior engineers, done R&D, and championed career advancement and learning.

My background is in:

**Making videogames**, which is about working collaboratively across many different disciplines (art, 3D modelling, animation, audio, design, game and engine code) to build something creative, often within hardware constraints; and

**Building workflow execution systems for large-scale data**, as one of the initial engineers of [Terra](https://terra.bio/), a cloud-based platform that allows genomics researchers to manage scientific tools and datasets and run their analyses at large scale.

You can see more about these things on my [resume](/resume).

### Things I enjoy doing

I love learning complex systems, exploring data to come up with ideas and test hypotheses, and then sharing what I've learned. I find teaching very rewarding, both giving talks and in writing. My communication style is curious, familiar, and conversational; you can see many examples over a wide range of topics on the [Writing](/writing) page.

I enjoy designing and building systems to achieve specific goals, technical or otherwise:
* In 2018 I took a three month sabbatical to investigate lossy compression of sequencing data, and created a new file format 4% the size of its source file and ~28% the size of its lossy competitor. I presented these results at the Global Alliance for Genomics & Health's 6th Plenary Meeting in Basel, Switzerland; watch the talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaqFBgaZHmE&t=13920s).
* In 2019 I led an effort with engineering managers to rethink our software engineering levels. (needs writeup, TBD; link to Trello)

Leading teams and mentoring and growing developers has been the most rewarding part of my career so far. I lead a great interview (from both sides of the table!) and care deeply about the (oft-ignored) new hire onboarding experience. I've also championed pushed for a 10% time policy (**better phrasing needed**).


### Things that could be my dream job

The most important thing to me is that the organization I'm with has a mission I care deeply about -- and that their work makes a meaningful, tangible difference in people's lives.

In that context, I could see myself flourishing:

* Running an R&D team where all new hires first land, blending onboarding and experimentation
* Doing technical research / advisory work for policy groups
* Being an organization's go-to person for engineering career progression: onboarding, levelling / promotions, professional development / continuing education, mentoring, etc
