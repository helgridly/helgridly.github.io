# Hi! I'm Hussein.

I've been in the software industry for 13 years. I have worn many hats: been an IC, done systems design, led teams, mentored junior engineers, done R&D, and championed career advancement and learning.

<div style="clear:left"></div>

## The kinds of work I love

### Learn -> explore -> teach

I love **learning complex systems**, exploring data to come up with ideas and test hypotheses, and **teaching** what I've learned.

üß¨ Read my [**crash course on genomics for computer scientists**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-C_BI4mx0Amjxac7G908Wtmfuc_N8O4_UqSDPiZu_bo/edit?usp=sharing)!

üí∏ Or maybe you'd prefer to learn [**the inner workings of options markets**](https://helgridly.github.io/finstuff/understanding-NOPE/)?

‚úç Plenty more on the [Writing](/writing) page.

### Solving high-impact problems

I'm naturally a **systems thinker** and am magnetically attracted to addressing big-ticket problems.

üóú DNA sequence data is huge. I **created a lossy compression format 4% the size of its source** file and ~28% the size of its competitor, presenting the results at the Global Alliance for Genomics & Health's 6th Plenary Meeting in Basel, Switzerland; watch [the talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaqFBgaZHmE&t=13920s) or flip through [the slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EAG3Mz_Rwszn1xzvLFlFDtZJKeTfTcqo/edit).

ü™ú Faced with discontent in our org, I led an effort with engineering managers to [**rebuild our software engineering career ladder**](/levels).

‚öô Plus more on the [Projects](/Projects) page.

### Growing engineers

Leading teams and **growing developers** has been the most rewarding part of my career so far. As well as [rebuilding our software engineering career ladder](/levels):

üìí I led the original development of [Leonardo](https://github.com/DataBiosphere/leonardo), a service that spun up [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) on Spark clusters in Google Cloud Platform.

üß† I lead a great interview: see my [**interviewing tips**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qNeXN_E_na_KXsZMaXRfYQcoT-0w59yjdmN1B7Tst68/edit#).

üîü I've also [pitched](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dgl6OwC9FHX-6oT9Z1JCmPglDmW9umv0/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114804907504664516654&rtpof=true&sd=true) and launched a [**10% time policy**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z81KCX6tuKLnSct5oFamhEvcFCJIPGOL/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114804907504664516654&rtpof=true&sd=true).

## Could you be my dream job?

I'd love to apply my skills and enthusiasm in a way that's rewarding and helpful. My career so far has been directly in tech, but the most important thing to me is that the work I do makes a **meaningful, tangible** (positive!) difference in people's lives.

In that context, I could see myself flourishing in all sorts of roles:

* Doing **technical research / advisory work** for policy groups
* Running an **R&D team** where all new hires first land, blending **onboarding and experimentation**
* Being an organization's go-to person for **engineering career progression**: onboarding, levelling / promotions, professional development / continuing education, mentoring, etc

...or some other role we create together!

Sound interesting? üôÇ You can read my resume [here](/resume). I'd love to hear from you: `hussein@thisdomain`
