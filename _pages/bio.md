I was born in Cairo, Egypt and grew up in the UK, in the northwest of London. I pronounce my first name more like "huh-sane" than "who-sane", something like [this](http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=h%C9%99%CB%88se%C9%AAn). My surname sometimes gives people trouble if they panic, but it's just all the sounds in order.

I started my career in the video games industry, which is about working collaboratively across many different disciplines (art, 3D modelling, animation, audio, design, game and engine code) to build something creative, often within hardware constraints. Titles I've worked on include [Enslaved: Odyssey to the West](https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/enslaved-odyssey-to-the-west), [DmC: Devil May Cry](https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/dmc-devil-may-cry), and the multiplayer for [Batman: Arkham Origins](https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/dmc-devil-may-cry).

As I got older, both [crunch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crunch_(video_games)) and the often-toxic gaming community became steadily less appealing, and I emigrated to the US to work at the [Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](https://www.broadinstitute.org/). As a longtime (and enthusiastic) employee I was featured in a ["come work for us" promotional video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lC-dqmwxR3M), the closest I've come to being famous.

I am a Practice Leader at [Greater Boston Zen Center](https://bostonzen.org/) on Tuesday nights and have been sitting with them for seven years.

I like to rock climb, and I'm a fair-weather sailor on Boston Harbour. My favourite boat is the [Lightship Nantucket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_lightship_Nantucket_(LV-112)), whose bell you can watch me gleefully ring below:

Very occasionally I construct crosswords, though none have made it to the New York Times yet. My latest is [Cold Season](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qi1vb5fpeuaskay/ColdSeason.pdf?dl=0).

## About the butterfly on my face

The picture of me on the landing page comes with a sad story.

Butterfly wings are all crinkled up and wet when they're in their chrysalis -- and extremely delicate. When the butterfly emerges, it pushes out some... juice(?) from its body into hollow vein-like structures in the wings, which is what uncrinkles them. Within a couple of hours, the wing juice hardens, giving the wings their final structure.

If something goes wrong with this process - maybe the butterfly lands badly and the wing gets bent, or the juice doesn't flow quickly enough - well, it hardens however it does, and it's permanent.

This butterfly got messed up wings and couldn't fly. The butterfly keeper said they put out fruit juice for the butterflies to drink - which ferments, so over the course of the day the butterflies get drunk. The butterfly was destined for a life of alcohol and not much else üôÅ

## Some reviews

[Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30753841-salt-fat-acid-heat) is an incredible book on the _technicals_ of how to cook. (You've probably seen the Netflix show!) I also own [The Food Lab](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24861842-the-food-lab) and [Lateral Cooking](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37941906-lateral-cooking),  which are both also in the genre of "read cover to cover and instantly become a better cook".

I have always been a night owl, and my [Philips SmartSleep wake-up light](https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Simulation-Headspace-Subscription-HF3520/dp/B0093162RM) made mornings go from alarm-clock-panic-rage to pleasant and gentle. Similarly, I can't live without my [Bose QC20](https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/headphones/earbuds/quietcomfort-20-acoustic-noise-cancelling-headphones.html) noise cancelling earphones, which travel everywhere with me.

I am a podcast junkie, but my favourite -- by a very long distance -- is [Everything Is Alive](https://www.everythingisalive.com/). It's a series of interviews with inanimate objects.

If you're going to London, I have a [list of recommendations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RVIJYion3K5695mZQpLEwD6r06FOU-zq/edit). I'm biased, but it's my favourite city by far.
