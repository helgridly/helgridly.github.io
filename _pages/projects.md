### Rethinking software engineering levels

In mid 2019 I took on a 50%-time role as "Advancement and Learning Facilitator" in Broad's Data Sciences Platform. One of my big projects in this role was to **rethink our software engineering ladder**.

You can read the writeup of that process [here](/levels).

### How much does Boston Police Department spend on surveillance equipment?

A project I did for the ACLU of Massachusetts' tech division, cross-referencing BPD's spending data (sourced from the City of Boston's [Checkbook Explorer](https://spending.data.boston.gov/)) against companies listed on the [Surveillance Industry Index](https://sii.transparencytoolkit.org/).

### Is there profit to be made trading SPAC warrants?

In late 2020 there was a craze in the financial markets for SPACs (special purpose acquisition companies, essentially shell companies that would search for a startup to merge with, to avoid the painful IPO process). Warrants are cheap financial instruments attached to SPACs, and are thus a way to potentially make big returns on small investments. There were many stories of traders doing this, so I scraped a _lot_ of data to find out if trading them was generally profitable. The short answer is "yes, if you have a time machine" -- soon after I did the analysis, the craze blew up, the market oversaturated, and this investment strategy got even more risky.

### A quick look at the 2017 Alabama special Senate election

The Doug Jones v. Roy Moore special Senate election in AL was close, and a particular breakdown of the vote totals went viral on social media. I decided to do a little digging of my own, and concluded that the biggest driver for the election was turnout, not race or gender.

### Other things

I also have many projects that got shelved, so if you'd ever like to discuss tracking political donations, or the extremely scammy end of the crypto market, feel free to ask!
