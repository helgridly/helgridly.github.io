### How much does Boston Police Department spend on surveillance equipment?

A project I did for the ACLU of Massachusetts' tech division, cross-referencing BPD's spending data (sourced from the City of Boston's [Checkbook Explorer](https://spending.data.boston.gov/) against companies listed on the [Surveillance Industry Index](https://sii.transparencytoolkit.org/).

GitHub repo with Jupyter notebook[here](https://github.com/helgridly/bpd-sii).

### Other things

I also have many projects that got shelved, so if you'd ever like to discuss tracking political donations, or the extremely scammy end of the crypto market, feel free to ask!
