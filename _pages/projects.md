### Rethinking software engineering levels

In mid 2019 I took on a 50%-time role as "Advancement and Learning Facilitator" in Broad's Data Sciences Platform. One of my big projects in this role was to **rethink our software engineering ladder**.

You can read the writeup of that process [here](/levels).

* SCRAM
* SPACs

### How much does Boston Police Department spend on surveillance equipment?

A project I did for the ACLU of Massachusetts' tech division, cross-referencing BPD's spending data (sourced from the City of Boston's [Checkbook Explorer](https://spending.data.boston.gov/)) against companies listed on the [Surveillance Industry Index](https://sii.transparencytoolkit.org/).

GitHub repo with Jupyter notebook [here](https://github.com/helgridly/bpd-sii).

### A quick look at the 2017 Alabama special Senate election

The Doug Jones v. Roy Moore special Senate election in AL was close, and a particular breakdown of the vote totals went viral on social media. I decided to do a little digging of my own, and concluded that the biggest driver for the election was turnout, not race or gender. Writeup [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eMpj1ZRfNhrW7pOCyq7jdnYA6_WT508jIT3Ku4TRr0U/edit#).

### Other things

I also have many projects that got shelved, so if you'd ever like to discuss tracking political donations, or the extremely scammy end of the crypto market, feel free to ask!
