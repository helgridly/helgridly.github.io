title: Building a new software engineering ladder
---

In mid 2019 I took on a 50%-time role as "Advancement and Learning Facilitator" in Broad's Data Sciences Platform. One of my big projects in this role was to **rethink our software engineering ladder**. This is a writeup of that process, and the result.

## The problem

The group had inherited a venerable document called the "Software Engineer Job Family Matrix", dated May 2011. It was a two-page table outlining job responsibilities and requirements at each level, and was written at a time when software engineers were typically hired in ones and twos, directly by PIs for their academic labs.

The document was widely considered to be a relic of its time and unsuitable for a software engineering group of 50-100 people. This caused a few problems:

* **Engineering Managers used their own heuristics** for judging when an employee was ready for promotion: a common one was "how much code can the engineer handle responsibly on their own?", ranging from "a function" for ASEs to "a moderately sized service" for PSEs.
* However, there was **a wide degree of variance between EMs** on other qualities necessary for promotion, especially around what was termed "soft skills".
* New leadership joining the organization felt that **titles were inflated by around one full level**, in part because there was little flexibility in comp inside salary bands: engineers got bumped up to the next band in order to attract and keep good talent.

As a result, engineers seeking promotion would sometimes be told "we don't think you're ready yet", with little provided in the way of actionable feedback. In a couple of cases, engineers were told by their managers they were a shoo-in for promotion, only to have their promo vetoed at the next EMs meeting. This understandably caused quite some consternation in the group.

### Questions arise

In response to this, engineering leadership met to ask and answer some questions:

* What are the actual criteria that EMs are using?
* How do we make sure that promotion criteria are being applied consistently between EMs?
* Can we use our engineering ladder as a way to move our desired skillset away from the "brilliant jerk" archetype, towards prioritizing maturity and collaboration?

### The vision

We decided a good career ladder should have the following attributes:

- A set of rubrics with very clear, check-off-able criteria for each level;
- Finer granularity on those criteria, leading to more consistency between EMs;
- Any disagreement between EM and employee should be focused on "are these sufficient examples of me fulfilling this criteria", not "what are the criteria";
- Criteria are specific enough that EMs + reports can actively build opportunities to demonstrate them.

## The process

### Build a deck of "skill cards"

With help from an interested EM and an enthusiastic SE seeking promotion feedback, I sought out engineering ladders from other companies (including Medium's [snowflake model](https://medium.com/s/engineering-growth-framework) and Rent the Runway's [great spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k4sO6pyCl_YYnf0PAXSBcX776rNcTjSOqDxZ5SDty-4/edit#gid=0)) and decomposed them into "skill cards", each of which had a **single** criteria, attribute, or quality that an engineer might have or display.

Both the original job matrix document we used, and many of the engineering ladders we found online, were very skewed towards listing technical skills. We took extra care to find and create skill cards around collaboration and emotional maturity

-- find the list: rent the runway, a few others (mohs help plz)
-- extra focus on acquiring and creating skill cards that exemplify collaboration + emotional maturity

### Prder the skills relative to each other

- for each skill card, play Price Is Right (should this go higher? lower?) on a trello board where the columns are labelled with numbers, not titles; this prevents people anchoring skills to their preconceptions of levels so they can focus on relative skill; freely introduce intermediate columns as necessary

### define the level boundaries

- then argue where the level boundaries should be based on the columns

### communicate to engineers

- carefully!

## the result

- link to the trello board
- engineers a little overwhelmed, but appreciation for the clarity
- EM + leadership turnover + "no budget for promotion" -> explicit use of this fell by the wayside
- from what i hear, gradual attrition of longtimers with institutional memory; hard to transfer that knowledge to newer hires

## Since then

this has become A Whole Thing, see https://www.progression.fyi/. it's validating that people are doing similar things, though it does make it harder for me to claim i was being innovative and thoughtful :) but at the time, that website didn't exist, and this project was much more of a pain in the ass...
