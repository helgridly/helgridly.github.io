# the problem

- job matrix was perceived to be "old"
- EMs were using their judgement on promotions - inconsistent across managers
- new leadership felt that titles were inflated by a full grade: hard to change salary bands at a research-focused nonprofit, software engineers requiring more comp to attract good talent

this led to employees being told "we don't think you're ready yet" without actionable feedback. in a couple of cases engineers were told they were a shoo-in for SSE but then got vetoed at EMs meeting. unclear, inconsistent answers to "what do i have to do to be promoted?"

### questions arise:
- what are the actual criteria that EMs are using
- how do we make sure they're applied consistently between EMs
- can we use levels as a way to move away from the "brilliant jerk" archetype to prioritize maturity and collaboration

### the vision:
- a set of rubrics with very clear, check-off-able criteria for each level
- finer granularity on those criteria -> less "wobble" between EMs
- any disagreement between EM and employee focused on "are these sufficient examples of me fulfilling this criteria"
- criteria are specific enough that EMs + reports can actively build opportunities to demonstrate them

# the process

### build a deck of "skill cards"

- go find other people's software level rubrics and decompose them into individual "skill cards"
-- find the list: rent the runway, a few others (mohs help plz)
-- extra focus on acquiring and creating skill cards that exemplify collaboration + emotional maturity

### order the skills relative to each other

- for each skill card, play Price Is Right (should this go higher? lower?) on a trello board where the columns are labelled with numbers, not titles; this prevents people anchoring skills to their preconceptions of levels so they can focus on relative skill; freely introduce intermediate columns as necessary

### define the level boundaries

- then argue where the level boundaries should be based on the columns

### communicate to engineers

- carefully!

# the result

- link to the trello board
- engineers a little overwhelmed, but appreciation for the clarity
- EM + leadership turnover + "no budget for promotion" -> explicit use of this fell by the wayside
- from what i hear, gradual attrition of longtimers with institutional memory; hard to transfer that knowledge to newer hires

# since then

this has become A Whole Thing, see https://www.progression.fyi/. it's validating that people are doing similar things, though it does make it harder for me to claim i was being innovative and thoughtful :) but at the time, that website didn't exist, and this project was much more of a pain in the ass...
